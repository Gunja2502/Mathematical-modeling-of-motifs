# Biological Pathways and Signaling Systems in *E. coli*

## 1. Asparagine Biosynthetic Pathway

üìÑ **File:** `Documentation_Asparagine_Pathway.pdf`

### Description

This document explains the asparagine biosynthetic pathway in *E. coli*, focusing on the regulatory role of AsnC and the enzyme asparaginase.

### Key Concepts

- **AsnC (Transcription Factor):** Activates the expression of the `asnA` gene, which encodes asparaginase.
- **Asparginase:** Converts the aspartate (substrate) to L-aspargine (product).
- **L-Asparagine:** Binds AsnC to form the AsnC-asparagine complex (TfM), inhibiting further asparaginase production via a negative feedback loop.

### Model Details

- **Regulatory Mechanism:** Negative feedback regulation of asparaginase synthesis.
- **Mathematical Model:** Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing interactions between transcription factors, metabolites, and enzymes.
- **Python Simulation Code:** Simulates the dynamics of the asparagine biosynthetic pathway over time.

## 2. PhoQ/PhoP Two-Component System

üìÑ **File:** `Simulations_of_a_two-component_system_(E_coli).pdf`

### Description

This document contains Python code for simulating the PhoQ/PhoP two-component system in *E. coli*. This system is crucial for bacterial adaptation to changes in environmental Mg¬≤‚Å∫ levels.

### Key Components

- **PhoQ:** Sensor kinase that phosphorylates itself in response to environmental signals.
- **PhoP:** Response regulator that gets phosphorylated by PhoQ.
- **MgrB:** Negative feedback regulator that inhibits PhoQ.

### Simulation Details

- **Initial Conditions:** Concentrations of PhoQ, PhoP, PhoQ-P, PhoP-P, and MgrB.
- **Parameters:** Rates of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and feedback inhibition.
- **Output:** Time-evolution plots of system components (PhoQ, PhoP, PhoQ-P, PhoP-P, and MgrB).
